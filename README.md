The number of malware is increasing day by day and affecting people across the world. The times when malware was just for fun are officially over. Cybercriminals are utilizing it for concentrated attacks on institutions, to collect the data about infected victims, steal the banking accounts, or encrypt the victims' data and ask for ransom. Old fashion antivirus companies with huge malware analysis departments can't keep up with the pace to create the antidotes for this threat. Everyone's eyes are now on new technologies and how to make the antimalware solutions more robust and fast. This task is for the data scientists that are brave enough to dive into computer science. The job is to empower machine learning by separating the files into clean (benign) or malicious. While working on this task,  investigate and learn how to preprocess data for the model. How much data is needed to increase the accuracy? How to reduce the number of false positives? The goal is to have a file preprocessing pipeline with a working model, predicting the malware with the highest accuracy on a given dataset. And, of course, having the minimum number of false positives at the same time.
